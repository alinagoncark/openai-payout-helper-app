In MGP page MANGOPAY  we can see that there is 10.93 EUR balance in the escrow wallet. It means that these funds are meant for the seller due to the transaction and payment. But, after the investigation, we can see that the seller is blocked from MGP side (MANGOPAY) therefore these funds cannot be accepted by him. Let me know if this is clear of if I should clarify more."},
